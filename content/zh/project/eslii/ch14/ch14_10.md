In this section we give a brief description of the original PageRank algorithm
used by the Google search engine, an interesting recent application
of unsupervised learning methods.

We suppose that we have N web pages and wish to rank them in terms
of importance. For example, the N pages might all contain a string match
to “statistical learning” and we might wish to rank the pages in terms of
their likely relevance to a websurfer.

The PageRank algorithm considers a webpage to be important if many
other webpages point to it. However the linking webpages that point to a
given page are not treated equally: the algorithm also takes into account
both the importance (PageRank ) of the linking pages and the number of
outgoing links that they have. Linking pages with higher PageRank are
given more weight, while pages with more outgoing links are given less
weight. These ideas lead to a recursive definition for PageRank, detailed
next.

Let L ij = 1 if page j points to page i, and zero otherwise. Let c j =P N
i=1 L ij equal the number of pages pointed to by page j (number of out-
links). Then the Google PageRanks p i are defined by the recursive rela-
tionship

$$p_i = (1-d) + d \sum_{j=1}^N (\frac{L_{ij}}{c_j}) p_j \tag{14.107}$$

where d is a positive constant (apparently set to 0.85).

The idea is that the importance of page i is the sum of the importances of
pages that point to that page. The sums are weighted by 1/c j , that is, each
page distributes a total vote of 1 to other pages. The constant d ensures
that each page gets a PageRank of at least 1 − d. In matrix notation

$$\mathbf{p} = (1-d)\mathbf{e} +
d \cdot \mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}\_c^{-1}\mathbf{p}\tag{14.108}$$

where e is a vector of N ones and D c = diag(c) is a diagonal matrix with
diagonal elements c j . Introducing the normalization e T p = N (i.e., the
average PageRank is 1), we can write (14.108) as

$$\begin{align} \mathbf{p}
&= [(1-d)\mathbf{e}\mathbf{e}^T/N + d\mathbf{L}\mathbf{D}\_c^{-1}]\mathbf{p} \\\\
&= \mathbf{A}\mathbf{p}
\tag{14.109}\end{align}$$

where the matrix A is the expression in square braces.

Exploiting a connection with Markov chains (see below), it can be shown
that the matrix A has a real eigenvalue equal to one, and one is its largest
eigenvalue. This means that we can find p̂ by the power method: starting
with some p = p 0 we iterate

$$\mathbf{p}\_k \leftarrow \mathbf{A}\mathbf{p}\_{k-1};
\mathbf{p}\_k \leftarrow N\frac{\mathbf{p}\_k}{\mathbf{e}^T\mathbf{p}\_k}
\tag{14.110}$$

The fixed points p̂ are the desired PageRanks.

In the original paper of Page et al. (1998), the authors considered PageR-
ank as a model of user behavior, where a random web surfer clicks on links
at random, without regard to content. The surfer does a random walk on
the web, choosing among available outgoing links at random. The factor
1 − d is the probability that he does not click on a link, but jumps instead
to a random webpage.

Some descriptions of PageRank have (1 − d)/N as the first term in def-
inition (14.107), which would better coincide with the random surfer in-
terpretation. Then the page rank solution (divided by N ) is the stationary
distribution of an irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain over the N webpages.

Definition (14.107) also corresponds to an irreducible, aperiodic Markov
chain, with different transition probabilities than those from the (1 − d)/N
version. Viewing PageRank as a Markov chain makes clear why the matrix
A has a maximal real eigenvalue of 1. Since A has positive entries with
each column summing to one, Markov chain theory tells us that it has a
unique eigenvector with eigenvalue one, corresponding to the stationary
distribution of the chain (Bremaud, 1999).

A small network is shown for illustration in Figure 14.46. The link matrix
is

$$\mathbf{L} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\tag{14.111}$$

and the number of outlinks is c = (2, 1, 1, 1).

The PageRank solution is p̂ = (1.49, 0.78, 1.58, 0.15). Notice that page 4
has no incoming links, and hence gets the minimum PageRank of 0.15.
