I visited the National Museum in the weekend.
The overwhelming color of red made the site quite different
from it used to be.
The safety check was so strick that pens were not allowed.
The hall and all the rooms on ground floor were for the new exhibition.
It was so crowded.

After a quick peek, I wandered down to the Ancient China exhibition.
Very fortunately I found a guide leading a family of three.
They attracted a pack of people around.
I followed almost the whole tour.

The usual spot of the souvenir store was taken for the Great Reform.
But I found it relocated outside the main building.
