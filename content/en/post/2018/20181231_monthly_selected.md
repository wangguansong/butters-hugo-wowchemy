## Untitled

December has the shortest days of the year,
but it will grow longer.
There are too few photos to summerize themes.

## Eva and the White

Eva is so hairy that she looks like the way she looked straying outside.

## Other Cats

It gets colder and cats come to the Cat Cafe frequently.
Although sometimes they fight at night.
I met Li Ronghao one day and he looked bad.

## About Butters

Only half a selfie, whatever.
I found a few plaid shirts at home,
which were actually bought before the "coders" story went on.
