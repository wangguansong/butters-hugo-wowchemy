title: "Re-reading A Song of Ice and Fire"
summary: >
  I got a kindle for myself and decided to reread the series of A Song of
  Ice and Fire.
---


I planned to get myself a kindle for my birthday, but what's the point
to wait for it? This is the fourth kindle I bought and finally it is for
myself. Apparently I have reached a life stage that reading is relaxing
to both my eyes and mind.

As the new season and book coming soon, I decide to reopen the series of
A Song of Ice and Fire. I got the kindle on the end of March and now I
get to 30% of the first book. I don't know if I can finish all in time
before the new book's release.

Anyway, knowing plots from later of the timeline gives me a new
perspective, which makes rereading quite interesting. Some seemingly
trivial dialogues and details become meaningful.

Here I'm going to keep records of my progress and favorite quotes.

## A Feast for Crows: 2018-08-15 ~ 2022-01-01

> A prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her
> mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how
> fine, how good this is...and then her teeth snap shut and your moans
> turn to screams. That is the nature of prophecy.<br/>
> (Gorghan told Sam his opinion on prophecy.)

## A Storm of Swords: 2017-11-04 ~ 2018-08-15

> His father had spent his life grubbing in other men's fields and
> collecting leeches. He'd strip down bare but for a thick leather
> clout, and go wading in the murky waters. When he climbed out he'd be
> covered from nipple to ankle. Sometimes he made Chett help pull the

> (The perfect irony)

> "You freed hime without my knowledge or consent... but what you did, I
> know you did for love. For Arya and Sansa, and out of grief for Bran

> we, Mother?"<br/>
> (Robb knew what he did was great folly.)

> He looked her in the eyes, proud and miserable all at once. "It was

> will make me a good wife."<br/>
> (Honor)

> "Now why would you doubt a mighty man like me? It was winter and I was
> half a boy, and stupid the way boys are. I went too far and my horse
> died and then a storm caught me. A true storm, not no little dusting

> <br/>
> "If she nursed you, you couldn't have killed her"<br/>
> "I never did, but see you don't go spreading that about. Tormund
> Giantsbane has a better ring to it than Tormund Giantsbabe, and that's
> the honest truth o' it."<br/>
> ......<br/>
> "Well, here's a tale for you. It were another winter, colder even than

> only a cask o' mead to keep me company and nothing to do but drink it.
> The more I drank the more I got to thinking about this woman lived
> close by, a fine strong woman with the biggest pair of teats you ever

> and in the deep of winter a man needs his warmth.<br/>
> "The more I drank the more I thought about her, and the more I thought
> the harder me member got, till I couldn't suffer it no more. Fool that
> I was, I bundled meself up in furs from head to heels, wrapped a
> winding wool around me face, and set off to find her. The snow was
> coming down so hard I got turned around once or twice, and the wind
> blew right through me and froze me bones, but finally I come on her,
> all bundled up like I was.<br/>
> "The woman had a terrible temper, and she put up quite the fight when
> I laid hands on her. It was all I could do to carry her home and get
> her out o' them furs, but when I did, oh, she was hotter even than I
> remembered, and we had a fine old time, and then I went to sleep. Next
> morning when I woke the snow had stopped and the sun was shining, but
> I was in no fit state to enjoy it. All ripped and torn I was, and half
> me member bit right off, and there on me floor was a she-bear's pelt.
> And soon enough the free folk were telling tales o' this bald bear
> seen in the woods, with the queerest pair o' cubs behind her. Har!" He
> slapped a meaty thigh. "Would that I could find her again. She was
> fine to lay with, that bear. Never was a woman gave me such a fight,
> nor such strong sons neither."<br/>
> "What could you do if you did find her?" Jon asked, smiling. "You said
> she bit your member off."<br/>
> "Only half. And half me member is twice as long as any other man's."
> Tormund snorted.

> Jaime had decided that he would return Sansa, and the younger girl as
> well if she could be found. It was not like to win him back his lost
> honor, but the notion of keeping faith when they all expected betrayal
> amused him more than he could say.<br/>
> (Men are just children.)

> "It's not music he hates," said Lem. "It's you, fool."<br/>
> "Well, he has no cause. The wench was willing to make a man of him, is
> it my fault he drank too much to do the deed?"<br/>
> Lem snorted through his broken nose. "Was it you who made a song of
> it, or some other bloody arse in love with his own voice?"<br/>
> "I only sang it the once," Tom complained. "And who's to say the song
> was about him? 'Twas a song about a fish."<br/>
> "A floppy fish," said Anguy, laughing.<br/>
> (A dirty joke.)

> I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she
> drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh,
> I woke from the terror.<br/>
> (So it might be Nymeria who drag Lady Stoneheart out of water.)

> There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a
> sword or spear and send him forth to war, the beast stirs. The scent
> of blood is all it takes to wake him.<br/>
> (Jorah Mormont to Daenerys.)

> "Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought noble, Rhaegar fought
> honorably. And Rhaegar died."<br/>
> (Jorah Mormont to Daenerys.)

> If this is so wrong, he wondered, why did the gods make it feel so
> good?<br/>
> (Jon felt about laying with Ygritte in the cave.) 

> In the Seven Kingdoms it was said that the Wall marked the end of the
> world. That is true for them as well. It was all in where you stood.
> And where do I stand?<br/>
> (Jon had doubt on his identity.)

> Sometimes I think everyone is just pretending to be brave, and none of
> us really are. Maybe pretending is how you get brave, I don't know.<br/>
> (Grenn to Samwell, about people calling him "slayer".)

> "Be careful how you bark, dog. We hold your life in our hands."<br/>
> "Best wipe the shit off your fingers, then." The Hound laughed.<br/>
> (Did the Hound mean his life was shit, or "Don't hold my life with
> your shitty hands"?)

> Life would be much simpler if men could fuck themselves, don't you
> agree.<br/>
> (Tyrion to Bronn.)

> In battle a captain's lungs were as important as his sword arm.<br/>
> (Eddard Stark once told Jon.)

> There are old sellswords and bold sellswords, but no old bold
> sellswords.<br/>
> (Brown Ben to Daenerys.)

> He's me, Jaime realized suddenly. I am speaking to myself, as I was,
> all cocksure arrogance and empty chivalry. This is what it does to
> you, to be too good too young.<br/>
> (Jaime felt about Loras Tyrell.)

> "I wish I had enough poison for you all. You make me sorry that I am
> not the monster you would have me be, yet there it is."<br/>
> (Tyrion's rant on his trial.)

> It all goes back and back, Tyrion thought, to our mothers and fathers
> and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those
> who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our
> strings and dance on in our steads.

> "You fought us hard here." Tormund turned his garron back toward the
> wildling camp. "You and your brothers. I give you that. Two hundred
> dead, and a dozen giants. Mag himself went in that gate o' yours and
> never did come out."<br/>
> "He died on the sword of a brave man named Donal Noye."<br/>
> "Aye? Some great lord was he, this Donal Noye? One of your shiny
> knights in their steel smallclothes?"<br/>
> "A blacksmith. He only had one arm."<br/>
> (Jon met Tormund after the battle.)

> "Well, the hottest fires burn out quickest."<br/>
> (Surprisingly poetic words from Tormund, commenting on Ygritte's death.)

> Varys smiled. "Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides.
> No more and no less."<br/>
> "So power is a mummer's trick?"<br/>
> "A shadow on the wall," Varys murmured, "yet shadows can kill. And
> ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow."

> Dany was horrified. "Do you hate her?"<br/>
> "Almost as much as I love her," Ser Jorah answered.<br/>
> (Ser Jorah told Dany about his wife and why he was exiled.)

> Mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own
> hawk. She was older now, but if she had a hawk she'd eat it.<br/>
> (Arya on the road.)

> "What if the wolves come?"<br/>
> "Yield," Arya suggested.<br/>
> (Arya answered Lommy who always said to yield.)

> "The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a
> blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called
> him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but for
> Howland Reed." Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no more.
> Bran wished he had asked him what he meant.

> Pity filled Catelyn's heart. Is there any creature on earth as
> unfortunate as an ugly woman?<br/>
> (When Catelyn met Brienne the first time. Yes there would be a more
> unfortunate woman.)

> It is all a game to them still, a tourney writ large, and all they see
> is the chance for glory and honor and spoils. They are boys drunk on
> song and story, and like all boys, they think themselves immortal.<br/>
> (Catelyn's comment on Renly's host)

> Ser Boros Blount harrumphed. "No man threatens His Grace in the
> presence of the Kingsguard."<br/>
> Tyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow. "I am not threatening the king,
> ser, I am educating my nephew. Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros
> opens his mouth, kill him." The dwarf smiled. "Now that was a threat,
> ser. See the difference?"

> "Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of
> their own incompetence."
> (Tyrion Lannister)

> "Do it," she urged him after a moment. "Bastard. Do it. I can't stay
> brave forever."
> When the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him.<br/>
> Join lowered his sword. "Go," he muttered.<br/>
> Ygritte stared.<br/>
> "Now," he said, "before my wits return. Go."<br/>
> She went.

> "Lovelier than you know, sweet child. It's magic, you see.
> It's justice you hold. It's vengeance for your father."
> Dontos leaned close and kissed her again. "It's home."<br/>
> (Dontos gave Sansa the hair net.)

> No beast was as noisy as man.

> Bran thought about it. "Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?"<br/>
> "That is the only time a man can be brave," his father told him.<br/>
> (Bran Stark and Eddard Stark)

> "Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not.
> Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness.
> Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you."<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister to Jon Snow)

> A man could not always be where he belonged, though.

> "A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its
> edge."<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister to Jon Snow)

> Every flight begins with a fall.<br/>
> (Bran Stark's dream)

> "As I was saying... why is it that when one man builds a wall,
> the next man immediately needs to know that's on the other side?"<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister to Jon Snow)

> "Let them see that their words can cut you, and you'll never be free
> of the mockery."<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister to Jon Snow)

> "If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner
> of later someone will loose an arrow at him."<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister commenting)

> "We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont,
> lest we start to take ourselves too seriously."<br/>
> (Tyrion Lannister to Lord Mormont)

> Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had
> told him, grinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be
> heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as
> Samwell Tarly had.

> He had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than
> questions.

> No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world were a
> secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand.<br/>
> (Bran's observation on Theon)

> Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart.

> "Myrish. 'The Seasons of My Love.' Sweet and sad, if you understand
> the words. The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and I've
> never been able to put it out of my head."<br/>
> (Tyrion told Bronn about the music he was whistling.)

> "Go ahead, call me all the names you want," Sansa said airily. "You
> won't dare when I'm married to Joffrey. You'll have to bow to me and
> call me Your Grace." She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the
> table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish
> and plopped down into her lap.<br/>
> "You have juice on your face, Your Grace," Arya said.

> "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no
> middle ground."<br/>
> (Cersei's response to Eddard's advice of her leaving the city with her
> children)

> "Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow," they recited, their
> voices filling the twilit grove. "Night gathers, and now my watch
> begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no
> lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I
> shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am
> the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold,
> the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the
> shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to
> the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."

> "Watching is not seeing, dead girl."<br/>
> (Syrio Forel to Arya)

> "Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands
> strange and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer
> animals to the Sealord's menagerie. Such animals as you have never
> seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as
> stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers
> that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with
> scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things.<br/>
> "On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the
> Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been
> sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was

> his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the
> sunrise. 'Have you ever seen her like?' he asked of me.<br/>
> "And to him I said, 'Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a
> thousand like him,' and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named
> the first sword."<br/>
> Arya screwed up her face. "I don't understand."<br/>
> Syrio clicked his teeth together. "The cat was an ordinary cat, no
> more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw.
> How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only
> fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What
> curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten
> fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said 'her,' and
> that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?"

> In the songs, the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy.

> "They say the king loved to hunt. The things we love destroy us every
> time, lad. Remember that. My son loved that young wife of his. Vain
> woman. If not for her, he would never have thought to sell those
> poachers."<br/>
> (Commander Mormont talking about his son, Jorah Mormont)

> "In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven. The
> rest honor the old gods, and name no knights... but those lords and
> their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable.
> A man's worth is not marked by a ser before his name."<br/>
> (Maester Luwin told Bran)

> She did not realized that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the
> knight say, "No." His voice was strange, brusque. (Afterwards) He
> seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken.<br/>
> (Jorah just got back from the captain for messages. It is possible
> that Varys had sent a message to undo the previous one.)

> "Your father is not fearless," Catelyn pointed out. "He is brave, but
> that is very different."

> The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too
> deep for words.<br/>
> (On Eddard's last POV chapter)

> "The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. If
> that's true, Lord Eddard, tell me... why is it always the innocents
> who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones?"<br/>
> (Varys to Eddard)

> "So they will not love," the old man answered, "for love is the bane
> of honor, the death of duty.<br/>
> ...<br/>
> "Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's
> love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms...
> or the memory of a brother's smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We

> great glory, and our great tragedy.<br/>
> ...<br/>
> "A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear.
> And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it. How easy it seems

> (Maester Aemon answered why the Night's Watch take no wives and father
> no children)
