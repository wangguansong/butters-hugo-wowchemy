summary: >
  Selected photos taken in January 2020.
  Like some story in a movie,
  people live their lives as usual,
  well a horrible virus is plotting against the world.

  I'm happy to be back home with my family and two cats.

  caption: >
    "A Message to Garcia", a book gifted to me by my elementary school teacher in the 2000s.
    It's still in its original plastic wrapping so I give it a read in this prolonged holiday.
    I feel lucky not openning it up when I was still young and naive, as this book stinks even amoung those chicken soup craps from the one percents.
    It's just a simple editorial on an event during the American-Spanish war to talk about initiative,
    and several other essays talking about how great this editorial was.

## About Butters

### Chinese New Year Trip

During the year of SARS, I lived in school separated from the world,
so I was not that nervious at all.
But now I put on face mask on the first notice.
The pandemic just starts to spread,
and not all of the people in public wear masks.

I bought a round trip flight with barely any discount.
I tried to travel via trains transfering in Beijing.
Even though I was able to score a ticket from Shenzhen to Beijing,
I couldn't get the one from Beijing to Shenyang.

### Butters' Craps

During the prolonged holidays, I sorted through some old stuff of mine.
I found two game strategy books reminding me
that I used to be an idiotic teenager.
"A Message to Garcia" is a book gifted by my elementary school teacher in the 2000s.
It's still in its original plastic wrapping.
I gave it a read and realized I was lucky skipping the book when I was young and naive.
And now it greatly boosted my confidence to write a book.

### Selfies

This is my first ever selfie stick,
and the first time I used it in public.

## My Cats: Eva and White

I got home for the Chinese New Year.
Nice to be together with families and my cats.

### Eva

Eva still remembered me,
because she didn't show any intention of hiding as she met strangers.
And she came to me for protection from harrassment of the White.

{{< gallery_remote album="eva_sofa" >}}

Eva has been completely used to the life here.
She even comes to the table asking for food every time we have a meal.
She is easy to maintain, so she has more privilege than the White.

{{< gallery_remote album="eva" >}}

### White

The White is another story.
He likes to chase Eva running around.
Even when Eva hides from him,
he still runs like a crazy cat by himself.

{{< gallery_remote album="white" >}}

### Eva and White

Normally Eva dislike to interact with White,
sometimes Eva will have a quick sniff of White and then quickly walk away.
But I notice Eva starts to fight back at White's harrassment,
rather than just escaping.
It's a rare scene to see them resting next to each other.

## People

Even though it's almost Chinese New Year,
girls on the streets still wear skirts.
Still a lot of people hang out in Shenye Uptown mall.

{{< gallery_remote album="shenye" >}}

## Animals

A human-friendly kitten appears in the community,
attracting a lot of children to the cuteness.
Some kids ask their parents if they can keep it.

{{< gallery_remote album="animal" >}}

## Plants

It's a local custom to buy orange trees for Chinese New Year in Guandong.
Almost all companies have one or two.
Half of the booths in the New Year goods market are selling orange trees.
