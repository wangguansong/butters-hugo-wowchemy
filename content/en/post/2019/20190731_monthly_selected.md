  Selected photos taken in July 2019.
  Getting busier at work, I basically find a corner and rest in the weekend.

## Misc

The work gets busier and busier so that I have little time for recreation.
There are only some daily photos.

{{< gallery_remote album="misc" >}}

## Animals

I have seen the info board about the snakes in the woods and heard stories,
but I really see a dead snake killed by car in the morning.
And twice I have seen living snakes during morning exercise.
Now I have to keep eyes on the path when walking the trail.

## CAFEEX Shenzhen

I visit the Shenzhen Coffee Exibition with friends.
There are a lot of people.
People in the coffee culture like tattoos,
and oddly they all look pretty.
We watch a cupping test competition and learn how professionals taste coffee.
I order a hot water kettle to make coffee in the office.

## Shenzhen Museum

It is holding the exhibit of the tomb of Marquis of Haihun.
The museum is packed with noisy kids.
However, it is good to see kids in the museum than playing video games.

## About Butters

No selfie this month, just some food.

{{< gallery_remote album="butters" >}}

Before the last basketball game,
I find some water accumulated in the corner of the kitchen
right before I am ready to leave.
I open the shelf under the sink and find the valve is leaking.

I contact the management company and they can fix it tomorrow,
so that I won't be able to shower after the game.
So I decide to fix it myself.

I go to the hardware store nearby and purchase new pipes and valves.
The store owner borrows me some tools to pull the broken valve out of the pipe.
I gain a great sense of achievement after it is done
and clean the dead cockroaches out of the shelf at the same time.
