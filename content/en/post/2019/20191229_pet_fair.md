## Dogs

There are two huge Old English Sheepdogs
in the dogs running contest field of the fair.
They have fluffy long hair covering their bodies.

{{< gallery_remote album="sheepdog" >}}

I cannot tell the difference of Shiba and Akita by their looks.
They absolutely dominate the dogs section.

## Cats

The dominance of the cat sections belongs to Ragdools.
All the cat stalls have a couple of them.
But the most attractive cats are the Maine cats.
There are a few sitting outside the cage because of their super nice nature.
People love to pet them, while they don't seem to enjoy it.

There are a lot stalls selling cats.
Some people also bring their own cats.

## Reptiles

The most crowded stall in the hall is the one of reptiles.
It has hermit crabs, lizards, spiders, centipedes, snakes,
and other odd kinds of animals.

## Phone Case

A cat-loving elder man has a cute cat-shaped phone case.
To capture a photo of him, I follow him around the whole exhibit hall.

## People

The girl giving away snack samples is surrounded by a few dogs,
and gets scratched by an excited dog.
