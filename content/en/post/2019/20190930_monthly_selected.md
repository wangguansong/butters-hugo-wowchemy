## Shantou

Jay and I have a trip to Chenghai Dist. Shantou in the beginning of the month.
We have a Chaoshan beef hotpot there as well.
I cannot tell any difference with the Chaoshan resturants in Shenzhen.
However in Shantou the waitress help pre-washing the bowls and chopsticks.

We take a walk in the Zhongshan park after lunch.
The park integrates Shantou Botanic Garden, Shantou Zoo, Shantou Museum,
and the Anti-Japan War Memorial.
I can feel slow life style in the old town.

## Nanshan

I climb Nanshan in the weekend.
I expected it as easy as Lianhuashan, however it is tougher to finish.
Over my head there are planes that just take off.
On top of the hill I can see the downtown of Nanshan District and Shekou.
When I get down I am soaking wet.
I happen to wander into the Sea World and have a coffee at Starbucks.
Nanshan is so far away that it takes longer to go to Nanshan than to go to Guangzhou.

## Exhibit of Cats

There is a cat themed exhibit in Shenye Uphill mall.
It is a small exhibit, not many photos, artworks, or souvenirs.

{{< gallery_remote album="cat_ex" >}}

## Taking Photos

Shenye Uphill mall becomes the Sanlitun in Shenzhen.
Besides the "street photographors", there are also many models working for Taobao stores.

{{< gallery_remote album="photo" >}}

## Miscellaneous

Some random pictures.

{{< gallery_remote album="misc" >}}

### Creatures at Basketball Courts

The cat at the basketball courts.
Sometime it stays on top of the front desk, being touched by so many sweaty hands.
Even though they look similar, I am willing to put a cricket in my palm,
while I want to kill the every last one of cockroaches.

{{< gallery_remote album="basketball" >}}

### Pet Store Cats

The cage remains and the cats come and go.

{{< gallery_remote album="pet_store" >}}

### Vegetables in the South

In the south, tomato and apple have fancier names.

{{< gallery_remote album="south" >}}

### Mimosa pudica

Near the exit of the trail around the lake
there is a field of touch-me-not.

{{< gallery_remote album="touchmenot" >}}

### Cleaning Eels

The fish stand owner is cleaning eels.

{{< gallery_remote album="eel" >}}

### Stray Cats

The orange can eat.
The baby dragon li is so afraid that it only comes out
after I push the orange away and step back.
It seems to be starving.
It licks my old cat food box as clean as a new one.

## About Butters

The arum I brought home from the wild lives,
but the touch-me-not doesn't.
So I have to buy a pot.

The touch-me-not closes its leaves at night.
So I can hardly see its full beauty,
since I leave before it opens up and come home after it closes.
I can hardly tell if it is stil alive sometimes.
