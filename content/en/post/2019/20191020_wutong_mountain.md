Last time in Wutong mountain,
we only reached Small Wutong before we headed back.
I've been planning for the Great Wutong before the National Day,
and finally make it happen in this weekend.
I buy a new backpack just for this.

## Taishan Creek Trail

Undefined and I choose the Taishan Creek trail to climb up.
The total mileage is more than 4 kilometers and
it takes us about three hours to finish.
We are basically exhausted for the last couple hundred meters.
We didn't get up too early for the trip,
and delay a little for entering a wrong path.
It is already 8 when we enter the trail.

Since we enter the trail we have been among a group of middle aged people.
They are so energetic that they sing, dance and yell to the head and tail of the line.
The natural sounds of running creek and birds are buried in their laughters.
Even when we reach the peak we can still hear their voice in the square on the halfway.

There is a cross-country race in the morning.
Once in a while some contestants will running by.
Just by seeing them jumping the stairs I can feel the pain in my knees.

## Mountain Top

In the small flat surface of the peak there stands lots of people.
A band is performing.
I have to give it to their willpower to carry all those heavy instruments up,
yet they still have the strenth to perform.

A lot of people take pictures in front of the rock with
"The Highest Peak of City Peng" and the altitude written on it.
The so-called "Heaven Pool" is unworthy of the name.

## Yantian

The other side of the Wutong Mountain is Yantian District and Yantian port.
The port looks magnificent.
Across the gulf is Hong Kong.
We receive all kinds of messages about Hong Kong data plans and notices.

## Hero's Slope

We climb down through the Hero's Slope.
It is shorter than the way up but steeper and tougher.

## Animals

The earthworms in the mountain grow as large as a baby snake.

## Plants

The plants in the mountain are not as thriving as those in the garden,
but they look more vigorous.

## People

I used to think climbing is a nice dating activity,
since the sweat will destroy the make-up of women.
But with a closer look I realized I was wrong.
The ladies still wear nice make-up even when they get down from the peak.

## Records.

From entering the trail till getting on the cab,
the total mileage is 16 kilometers and it takes more than 8 hours.
The Taishan Creek trail has 4300 meters and it takes about 3 hours climbing up.
