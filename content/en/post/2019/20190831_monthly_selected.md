  Selected photos taken in August 2019.
  Still busy, trivial matters are the most consuming.
  A little dog almost adopts me,
  but I have to let go thinking of my irregular living schedule.

## Miscellaneous

A busy and boring week, nothing worth mentioning.

{{< gallery_remote album="misc" >}}

There are cat cages outside the pet store.
Without Eva, I have to feel some cats every time I pass by.

{{< gallery_remote album="cat" >}}

I go to the Starbucks at the Shenye Uphill mall during weekend sometimes,
just sitting there and watching outside.
If I arrive at Lunch time I can get the best spot,
where I can see young people taking pictures outside.
