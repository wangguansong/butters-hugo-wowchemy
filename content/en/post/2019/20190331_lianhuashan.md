This is likely my first real weekend in Shenzhen that I can rest.
I decide to visit Lianhuashan (Lotus Hill) park without knowing much about Shenzhen's tourism spots.
It turns out to be a must place of the city.

There is a bronze statue of Mr. Deng on top of the hill.
Behind it is a monument with his words about Shenzhen's reform carved in.
The statue looks at the Citizen Square, which is probably the center of Shenzhen.

The park has a large variety of plants.
I know almost none of them.
There are just a few commonly seen plants in the north, while there are plenty in this park.
It is interesting that people in the south tend to be shorter but the plants tend to be huge.
The leaves usually have vivid colors or different stripes.
In comparison the leaves in the north are mostly pure green except in the autumn.

People here have something special about kites.
The lawn is full of adults and children running around.
As I can see the key of flying kite is to never stop running.
the kite will stay in the air as long as you keep running.
People can play on the lawn in Shenzhen, which is unlike in the northern cities.
The lawns in the north are so precious that they have to be protected by fences and warning signs.

Children have different ways to enjoy themselves besides running with kites.

I found the famous dating profile corner, quite a view.
The profiles are grouped by genders and age ranges.
I could feel the heat from the gazing of parents siting around
as soon as I walked inside.
It makes me nervous so I escape through the other exit.
