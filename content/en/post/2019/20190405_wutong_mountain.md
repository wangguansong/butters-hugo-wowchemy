summary: >
  On the first day of Qingming holidays I climb Wutong mountain with friends.
  The distance to Big Wutong is a little bit beyond our expectation,
  so we change course to Small Wutong and go downhill into the Xianhu Botanical Garden.
  It is a tough day so we reward ourself with Haidilao for dinner.

On the first day of Qingming holidays I climb Wutong mountain with friends.
On our first bus there are barely any people,
but for the transfer there are a long line to get on the bus.
Each bus is packed with people and the road has heavy traffic.
We walk through a bridge then call a taxi.
We arrive at the mountain gate at 9 am.

I thought it was similar to the Xiangshan in Beijing, but it is not.
We are exhausted when we arrive the cross road to either the Big Wutong or the Small Wutong.
Learning that there is only halfway to the Big Wutong,
we turn to the Small Wutong after resting and having some food.
The Shenzhen TV Tower is also located at the Small Wutong.

We climb a steep way downhill and enter the Xianhu Botanical Garden unknowingly.
It is a beautiful botanical garden, however we are too tired to enjoy it.
We walk in circles trying to find the exit.
We arrive the Hongfa Temple but have to return because the another exit is still far away.
There are so many people walking towards us to enter the park even it is close to sunset.
They probably go to the temple for some holiday event.

Along the climbing road there are many Alpine Rose trees,
which are in the final days of their blossom season.
Still there are few trees full of flowers, it must be a sea of flowers in the peak days.

A lot of butterfliles fly around.
The black ones with blue dots are beautiful and easy to find.
We also see a giant butterfly hanging on a tree.

The mountain and park are crowded due to the holidays.
We see a cat along the way.
Fortunately I have the cat snacks in my bag.
