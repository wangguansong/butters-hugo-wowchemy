summary: >
  I feel guilty to stay at home in the holiday
  even though I just climbed the Wutong Mountain yesterday.
  I have been reasearching the Yinhushan Countryside Park for a long while,
  so I find its entrance and take a 10 km hike.

The mountain is close to my apartment.
As I arrived at Shenzhen I've been thinking of climbing the mountain.
It's called Yinhushan (Silver Lake Mountain) Countryside Park.
Apparently it is considered as the countryside of Shenzhen,
while my apartment is even further from the city then the park.
It's difficult to find any definite description of its entrance online.
Most of the articles are about riding path and entering in the other side at Meilin.

Fortunately I managed to find the path after walking cross a construction site.
The main road is a tar road, allegedly 10 km.
A lot of bikers struggle to climb uphill, while only few hikers.
Later I realize most hiders walk in the trees
and there are various hidden path to enter the mountain.
(I find one in the route I run in the morning.)

On my way up I see many people drag multiple water jars downhill.
Are they coming back from a camping site?
Later I see that they are carrying spring water from the mountain.
I respect their pursuit of high quality water.

At around half of the route, there is an opening to a huge vacant field between mountains.
There is also a strange equipment, called "Olfosense-S, Odor on-line monitoring and sampling".
There must be the landfill site from the description online,
which is probably what the equipment is for.

Compared to the Lianhuashan or the Wutong Mountain,
the variety of plants is not that impressive.
However it looks more natural rather than cultivated.

Even though it is called a countryside park,
there are still a lot of people on the route.
Thus I cannot find any animals other than common insects and birds.
There is a sign on my exit noticing hikers to look out for poisonous snakes and bugs.

The final milage is 10.47 km, taking 3 hours.
The exit is by the outer wall of a military camp.
I would have missed it for sure if I came this way.
