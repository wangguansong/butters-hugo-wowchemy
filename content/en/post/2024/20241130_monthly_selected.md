  caption: I wandered around the urban villiage during lunch break. There are
    tiny clothing workshops, lanes which are dark even in the noon, and
    restaurants where delivery workers eat. If you walk ten minutes from here it
    will be a different world. The tall building on the left with commercial of
    Guojiao 1573 is the offices for outsourcing employees; HSBC that employs
    outsource locates in the tall building on the right (with the Swire logo).

  caption: On the way home I saw the people of the Coconut Chicken place carried
    out all the coconut saplings that were used for decoration by the windows. I
    was hoping that they were throwing them away so that I could pick up some.
    I hid behind a tree and waited, then they wiped all the saplings clean and
    put them inside the store.

    Mountain? "There used to be nothing over there and since some day a colorful
    and shiny tree grows and lights up the sky in the night."
