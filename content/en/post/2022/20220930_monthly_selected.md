## Nantai Wholesale Market

The market was quite empty. We circled around and saw the source of all those
food of chinese, western, japanese restaurants etc. The store owners usually
ignored us who looked not like serious buyers. A tableware store decorated the
place to cater retail customers and became famous on the internet. The products
looked like surplus orders of export trades. We bought some frozen hash browns
and several cups.

## Night Market at Fangcun Dock

Night markets became popular recently, we chose one to have a look. They all
felt the same in the era of internet. I still preferred the markets back home
in the northeast.
