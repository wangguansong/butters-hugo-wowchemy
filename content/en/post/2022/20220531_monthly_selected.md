We drove from Quanzhou to Guangzhou, bringing with us White the cat and
bags of food packed by my parents. As a cat, White should be called a
experienced one, who has been to Beijing, Shenyang, Quanzhou, and now
Guangzhou.

We brought back a lot of green onions, so I got some tofu skins, wrapped
onions inside, and ate with flour paste.

On the 20th (the 520 day) we wanted to try the Mexican resturant. It
turned out fully booked. When leaving my name for a reservation, the
waiter asked if my name "Wang" is in upper letter or lower letter. I
was confused and Diao was so mad that she told him it's "Wang" as in
"Wang Ba" (turtle). I don't know if we'll ever eat there.
