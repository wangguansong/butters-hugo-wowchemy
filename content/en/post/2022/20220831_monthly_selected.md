           and eat sometimes, It's just 13 yuan for a meal. We just want to make
           friends, since this couldn't make money anyway."

## Sheng's Restaurant

It's a Hong Kong style dinner near the subway station, which I fell for since
the first time I came here. However after a short while it had a 'shop for rent'
ad posted outside, and then a couple weeks later it was closed for good.

The food here was all right, nothing surprising. What attracted me was the detail
that showed the social phobia and casualness of the owner. We usually entered
at 8 pm, and for several times we were the last customers. All those came behind
us were asked out by the owner. Once we arrived a little bit later than usual, I
placed the order and then heard them discussing whether to cook those or not in
the kitchen. The owner seemed to avoid as much conversation with customers as
possible. When customers asked for something, he would pointed to whatever they
asked for (dinnerware or napkins) or to descriptions posted on the wall.

It made me sad to see its 'shop for rent' ad poster, and about two weeks later
it was closed for good. After the pork offal rice noodle place, this was the
second time that our favorite restaurant got closed. Best wishes to you all.

## White

Bring White to the vet for vaccine shoots. When asked for a vaccine shoot, the
vet probably had a kitten in mind. When I picked White out of his bag, the vet
wondered at how big it is.

## Zhujiang Park

The Zhujiang Park was at the other side of Zhujiang New Town, just walking to
the other direction from the subway station where Diao got to work. There were
a lot of stray cats in the park, and also a lot of people feeding them. Some
bold cats would come for some petting when they saw human coming, and some shy
ones would stay far and observe.

The park was small. It was about 2 to 3 kilometers for a lap. There was a Huanong
(South China Agricultural University) shop inside, and the cheese popsicle were
delicious. I had two of these, which successfully filled in the calorie I drained
in the walking.
