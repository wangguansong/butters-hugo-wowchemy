summary: >
  Selected photos taken in January 2022.
  Just like the Straw Hat Pirates, I resurface to the world after two years.
  The pandemic is still going on, life will probably never go back to what it used to be.
  But the nice thing is that I've got a partner for the rest of it.

## Two Years of COVID

It has been two years since the outbreak of COVID, but it feels like half of
my life. The memory of pre-COVID is gradually fading away, and people seems to
grow into the life with the pandemic. Next generation will get annoyed by their
parents telling how they used to live without masks.

Just before the Chinese new year, we both took the third booster vaccine. Wish
all a safe journey home.

## Guangzhou

There are still medium-risk areas in Shenzhen, so an asterisk is added for
Shenzhen in the itinerary records. For her trip home, Diao has to avoid
Shenzhen in her records. So I spend weekends in Guangzhou recently.

### Xiaoliu

Xiaoliu (Little Six) is a Labrador adopted by Diao's Friend.
Sometimes we takes her out for a walk.
She's a big and gentle dog. Everyone loves her.

### Zhongshan Memorial Hall

We used to pass by here without entering.
There are two levels of the building, exhibiting life stories of Sun Yat-sen
and the history of the construction of the memorial hall.
There is a rehearsal so the inner hall is closed to public.
Some tourists peak through the door, trying to have a look.

### Yuexiu Park

The name of Mount Yuexiu comes from the Yuewang (King of Yue) Tai (Platform)
constructed by Nanyue during the end of Qin dynasty. In the park there are a
section of city wall from the Ming dynasty and some other historic points of
interest.

## Family and Old Friends

The old gang of friends in Shenzhen scattered around the country to their own
lives. An old friend travels to Shenzhen from Chengdu for business, so three
old friends of us have a dinner downtown.

It comes to the Chinese New Year time again. Shenzhen successfully gets rid of
the asterisk from the itinerary records near the last days. I travel to stay
with my parents for the holiday.
