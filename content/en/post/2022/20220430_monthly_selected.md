## Baiyunshan

During the Qingming weekend, we went to climb the Baiyunshan for the very first time.
It's bigger than Lianhuashan of Shenzhen, but still it's an easy trip.
The weather was nice, and a lot of kids went rolling on the lawn.

## Xiguan

It's a waste to stay home on a three-days weekend, so we walked around Yongqingfang.
The cats could be sighted at every street.

## Yellow Health Code

It's finally Guanghzou's turn.
We passed through a controlled zone after we left Baiyunshan,
so our health QR codes turned yellow.
Fun fact, the "yellow" code is actually orange-ish, which looks quite scary.
Therefore we had to test 3 times in 7 days and could be stopped at the entrances.
Another fact, the PCR tests for yellow code people are through noses.
