## Camping

Friends organized a camping event, and we would love to tag along. The camping
site is near Nansha district. It looked like a un-used wetland by the river, and
then reconditioned into ponds and lawns for camping. We needed to prepare for
nothing except food and entertainment, since the camping tents and grill were
all set up when we arrived. We brought an american football and a frisbee, and
experienced the two hottest sports just a little bit. Interestingly Xiao Liu
(the labordor) showed no interest to the frisbee.

This reminded me of the school spring trips. It didn't matter where to go, what
to eat, and what to do. We would have a good time as long as we were out of
school and with our friends.

## Internet Popular Street

Yes, the name of this place on the map is just "OMG Internet Popular Street".
They say the extreme of earthy is just stylish, maybe it is also true in the
opposite direction.

There is a village just outside the subway station, and the streets were full of
food venders. The street food seems to become consistent everywhere in the era
of internet. The usual includes grilled cold noodle, stinky tofu, grilled oyster,
lemon tea, etc. I wonder when chicken rack (jijia) can become popular enough to
have a place here.

The street is actually an indoor mall, while decorated into different styles of
streets. The street in traditional chinese style was well developped and more
lively, with shows and games catering to the children. The street in western
style was quite; some shops were still under construction, and some others were
empty but with some interesting signboards in English. Diao said one visit would
be enough.

## Else

Mom visited for the first time after I moved to Guangzhou.
The full moon on the night of July 13th was said to be the largest of the year.
