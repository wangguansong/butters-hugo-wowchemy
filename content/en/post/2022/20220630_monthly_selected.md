## Oven

I bought an oven, and tried two recipes: grilled mackerel and garlic grilled
baguette.

## White the Cat

White has adapted to his new home and become more and more relaxed.

## Dongshanhu Park

We went to Dongshanhu Park in the weekend. There were some children running
around holding long antennas and wearing headsets. It could be some fancy new
game. There was a "Su - Xie Ying Art Gallery in the park. Later we walked through
Dongshankou streets and a lively neighborhood back to home.

## June

Some cityes of Guangdong has flooded recently, and some river-side streets in
Guanghzou has been covered by water for few days. I heard that it was likely
the highest water level, so we walked to the river bank to have a look.
